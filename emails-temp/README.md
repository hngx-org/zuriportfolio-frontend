## Creating an MJML File

2. Start writing your MJML code in this file.

## Previewing MJML Files

1. Open the MJML file you want to preview.

2. In the top right corner of the VS Code window, you will see an MJML icon (a pink "M" in a blue rectangle).

3. Click on the MJML icon to open the MJML Preview panel.

4. Your MJML code will be automatically compiled and displayed as an HTML preview.

## Editing and Saving

1. Edit your MJML code in the editor.

2. When you save your changes (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`), the preview will automatically update to reflect your modifications.

## Exporting HTML

If you want to export your MJML code as HTML, you can use the MJML extension to generate the HTML file. To do this, right-click on the MJML file in the file explorer and select "MJML: Export as HTML."
